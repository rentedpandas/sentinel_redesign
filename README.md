### To be deleted:

* Proper layout draft of the widgets; need proper visualization. **Progress:** test/tile_test.dart contains the layout.
* ~~TileBuilder() needs to be working for all of the other tiles.~~ Got rid of TileBuilder(), for now.
* NavigationDrawer() is either bugged or Flutter is bugged? Might open issue later on Flutter.
* Work on views, later.
* Integrate better web routing.
* Integrate existing JS apps into each Tile (seems relatively easy)
* Move TODO into issues.
