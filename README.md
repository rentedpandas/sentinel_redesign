# sentinel_redesign

Front end redesign of the Sentinel web application.

## Description

The redesign was made using the Flutter SDK, which uses the Dart programming language.

Redesigned by Alen Alshinbayev '21 and Brian Tan '21.

Original programming by Keith Voss.

## TODO

* Proper layout draft of the widgets; need proper visualization.
* TileBuilder() needs to be working for all of the other tiles.
* NavigationDrawer() is either bugged or Flutter is bugged? Might open issue later on Flutter.
* Work on views, later.
* Integrate better web routing.
